# Code Optimization and Refactoring

## Description

This repository contains a code block that exhibits computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns. The following issues have been identified:

- **Suboptimal useMemo Usage**: Unnecessary calculations are performed within useMemo, leading to performance overhead.
- **Spelling Error and Unclear Logic**: A variable, lhsPriority, is not defined properly within the useMemo function. Additionally, the getPriority function returns a default value but is not utilized where necessary.
- **Unnecessary Repetition**: Repetition exists in using map to create both formattedBalances and rows.
- **Lack of Error Handling**: There's no error handling or fallback mechanism if certain values are missing.
- **Missing Data Type Checks**: Data inputs are not checked for validity before usage.

## Proposed Improvements

To enhance the code, the following adjustments are suggested:

- **Maximize useMemo Usage**: Utilize useMemo effectively to perform calculations only when necessary, reducing unnecessary computations.
- **Validate Data Inputs**: Implement checks to ensure that data inputs are valid before usage.
- **Optimize Repetitive Processing**: Refactor the code to avoid unnecessary repetition and computations.
- **Handle Errors and Undefined Cases**: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle missing or invalid values explicitly.

Consider these adjustments to improve the efficiency and readability of the code.
